# Java Best Practices for Clean Code

Writing clean, maintainable Java code is an essential skill for any developer. In this article, we'll explore some fundamental practices that can significantly improve your code quality.

## 1. Meaningful Naming

Choose names that clearly express intent:

```java
// Bad
int d; // elapsed time in days

// Good  
int elapsedTimeInDays;
```

## 2. Single Responsibility Principle

Each class should have only one reason to change:

```java
// Good example
public class UserRepository {
    public User findById(Long id) {
        // Database logic only
    }
}

public class UserValidator {
    public boolean isValid(User user) {
        // Validation logic only
    }
}
```

## 3. Use Proper Exception Handling

```java
// Good
try {
    processUser(user);
} catch (UserNotFoundException e) {
    log.error("User not found: " + e.getMessage());
    throw new ServiceException("Unable to process user", e);
}
```

## Conclusion

Following these practices will make your Java code more professional and maintainable. Remember, clean code is not just about following rulesâ€”it's about making your intentions clear to other developers.
