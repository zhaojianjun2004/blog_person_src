# Building Microservices with Spring Boot

Microservices architecture has become the gold standard for building scalable, maintainable applications. Spring Boot provides excellent tools for implementing this pattern.

## What are Microservices?

Microservices are small, independent services that communicate over well-defined APIs. Each service:

- Has a single business responsibility
- Can be developed and deployed independently  
- Communicates via HTTP/REST or messaging

## Setting up a Spring Boot Microservice

### 1. Create the Basic Structure

```java
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableEurekaClient
public class UserServiceApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(UserServiceApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

### 2. Configure Application Properties

```yaml
server:
  port: 8081
  
spring:
  application:
    name: user-service
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/users
    username: ${DB_USER}
    password: ${DB_PASSWORD}
    
eureka:
  client:
    service-url:
      defaultZone: http://localhost:8761/eureka
```

## Service Communication

### Using RestTemplate

```java
@Service
public class UserService {
    
    @Autowired
    private RestTemplate restTemplate;
    
    public Order getUserOrders(Long userId) {
        return restTemplate.getForObject(
            "http://order-service/orders/user/" + userId, 
            Order.class
        );
    }
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Database per Service**: Each microservice should have its own database
2. **API Versioning**: Use versioning to manage changes
3. **Circuit Breaker**: Implement fault tolerance with Hystrix
4. **Centralized Logging**: Use ELK stack for log aggregation
5. **Health Checks**: Monitor service health with Actuator

## Conclusion

Spring Boot makes microservices development straightforward with its auto-configuration and ecosystem. Remember to consider the operational complexity when choosing this architecture.
